====================================
        BOOKSTORE MANAGEMENT
====================================

📖 Project Overview:
--------------------
This Java project demonstrates the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) — such as classes, objects, encapsulation, and collections — through a simple yet functional Bookstore Management System.

It includes two main components:
1. Book.java     → Represents a single book entity (title, author, price, ID, etc.)
2. BookStore.java → Handles a collection of books and provides operations like add, display, search, and delete.

The project is console-based and serves as a foundational example for beginners learning how to structure Java applications using OOP principles.


⚙️ Features:
------------
✔ Add new books to the store  
✔ Display all available books  
✔ Search books by title or ID  
✔ Delete or update book records  
✔ Follows clean object-oriented design  
✔ Easy to extend for future improvements (e.g., file storage, GUI, or database support)


🧠 Concepts Used:
-----------------
- Classes and Objects  
- Encapsulation and Data Hiding  
- ArrayList / Collection Framework  
- Constructors and Method Overloading  
- Input Handling and Exception Management


🚀 How to Run:
--------------
1. Open terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the folder containing both files:  
   → Book.java
3. Compile both files:
javac Book.java
javac BookStore.java

4. Run the program:
 → BookStore.java
java BookStore
